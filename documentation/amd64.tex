\startchapter{AMD64}{AMD64 Hardware Architecture Support}{amd64}
{This \documentation{} describes how the \ecs{} supports the AMD64 hardware architecture.
This includes information about the assemblers, disassemblers, and the various compilers featured by the \ecs{} as well as the interoperability between these tools.}

\section{Introduction}

The \ecs{} features various compilers, assemblers, and disassemblers that target the AMD64 hardware architecture by AMD\@.
Figure~\ref{fig:amd64dataflow} shows the data flow in-between these tools.

\end{figure}

All compilers targeting the AMD64 architecture translate their programs using an intermediate code representation.
The AMD64 generator is able to translate the intermediate code representation of a program into machine code for AMD64 processors.
It stores the resulting binary code and data in so-called object files.
Additionally, the generator is able to create an assembly code listing of the machine code for debugging purposes.
This assembly code listing can also be processed by the assemblers yielding exactly the same object file.
The disassemblers are able to open object files and print a human-readable disassembly listing of their contents.

\section{Instruction Set}

Tools targeting the AMD64 architecture support the instruction set listed in Table~\ref{tab:amd64set} and use the same assembly syntax as predefined by AMD~\cite{amd64:volume3,amd64:volume4,amd64:volume5}.
The only exception are instructions for far procedure calls and far jumps which take the selector and offset of the immediate far pointer as two separate operands.
The tools support all different modes of operation defined by the AMD64 architecture as described in Section~\ref{sec:amd64operatingmodes}.
The actual set of supported instructions depends on the operating mode that is used.
If there are two or more possible encodings of an instruction, the shortest one is used by default.
In order to specify the encoding of an instruction explicitly, the size of its operands can be overridden by prefixing them with one of the following identifiers:
\texttt{byte} for 8-bit, \texttt{word} for 16-bit, \texttt{dword} for 32-bit, \texttt{qword} for 64-bit, \texttt{oword} for 128-bit, and \texttt{hword} for 256-bit.

\section{Operating Modes}\index{Operating modes}\label{sec:amd64operatingmodes}

The AMD64 architecture defines several different operating modes which imply different operand and address sizes~\cite{amd64:volume1}.
Table~\ref{tab:amd64operatingmodes} summarizes the main differences between these operating modes.
All assemblers and compilers that target the AMD64 architecture support the following operating modes:

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llcc@{}}
\toprule
& & Default & Default \\
\multicolumn{2}{@{}c}{Operating Modes} & Address & Operand \\
& & Size & Size \\
\midrule & 64-bit Mode & 64 & 32 \\
\cmidrule(l){2-4} Long Mode & Compatibility Mode & 32 & 32 \\
\cmidrule(l){3-4} & (Legacy Modes) & 16 & 16 \\
\midrule & Protected Mode & 32 & 32 \\
\cmidrule(l){2-4} Legacy Mode & Virtual-8086 Mode & 16 & 16 \\
\cmidrule(l){2-4} & Real Mode & 16 & 16 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{AMD64 operating modes with default address and operand sizes}
\label{tab:amd64operatingmodes}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}

\item Real Mode, Virtual 8086 Mode\index{Real mode}\alignright 16-bit\nopagebreak

In 16-bit mode, addresses and operands have a default size of 16~bits.

\item Protected Mode\index{Protected mode}\alignright 32-bit\nopagebreak

In 32-bit mode, addresses and operands have a default size of 32~bits.

\item 64-Bit Mode\alignright 64-bit\nopagebreak

In 64-bit mode, addresses have a default size of 64~bits, whereas the size of operands usually remains 32~bits.
There are more and wider registers available in this mode.
Additionally, instructions implementing the 128-bit media programming model are available by design.

\end{itemize}

The actual operating mode the compilers and assemblers generate machine code for by default, is indicated by the number in the suffix of their names.
The assemblers allow users to temporarily switch between the supported operating modes by passing 16, 32 or 64 as operand to the bit mode directive.

\section{Calling Convention}\index{Calling convention!of AMD64}

The machine code generator and runtime support for the AMD64 architecture as provided by the \ecs{} use the following calling convention in order to enable interoperability.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

Arguments for functions are in general passed using the stack according to the intermediate code specification.
See \Documentation{}~\documentationref{code}{Intermediate Code Representation} for more information about the role of the stack.
Function arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order and cleaned by the caller.
If the AMD64 machine code generator runs out of physical registers, previously mapped registers are spilled on the stack.

\subsection{Floating-Point Support}

The AMD64 architecture natively supports floating-point operations by providing two different floating-point programming models.
The first is the x87 floating-point programming model which is used as a fallback for the newer 128-bit media programming model.
Compilers for the 64-bit mode use the 128-bit media programming model by default.
Other tools use the standard x87 floating-point programming model.

\subsection{Register Mapping}

The special-purpose registers defined by the intermediate code representation are mapped to their corresponding physical registers in the following way:

\begin{itemize}

\item Result Register\alignright\texttt{\$res}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code result register \texttt{\$res} is mapped to AMD64 registers \texttt{al}, \texttt{ax}, \texttt{eax}, depending on the size of the actual result value.
64-bit wide results are stored in registers \texttt{eax} and \texttt{edx}, or only in register \texttt{rax} in 64-bit mode.
Floating-point results are stored in registers \texttt{st0} or \texttt{xmm0} depending on the floating-point programming model.

\item Stack Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$sp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code stack pointer register \texttt{\$sp} is mapped to AMD64 registers \texttt{sp}, \texttt{esp},
or \texttt{rsp} depending on the target operating mode.

\item Frame Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$fp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code frame pointer register \texttt{\$fp} is mapped to AMD64 registers \texttt{bp}, \texttt{ebp},
or \texttt{rbp} depending on the target operating mode.

\item Link Register\alignright\texttt{\$lnk}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code link register \texttt{\$lnk} is not supported.

\end{itemize}

All other intermediate code registers are mapped as needed to the remaining physical registers.
Their contents and mapping are therefore considered volatile across function calls.
Registers holding integer and address values are mapped to the general-purpose registers.
Registers holding floating-point values are either mapped to the physical registers of the 128-bit media programming model,
or stored on the floating-point stack provided by the x87 floating-point programming model.

\section{Runtime Support}\index{Runtime support!for AMD64}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for the AMD64 architecture and runtime environments based on this hardware architecture in object files.
Users targeting a specific runtime environment have to use an appropriate linker together with these object files in order create an executable program.
This section gives information about all supported runtime environments based on the AMD64 hardware architecture as well as the required combination of linker and object files.

Basic architectural runtime support is provided by the object files \objfile{amd16\-run}, \objfile{amd32\-run}, and \objfile{amd64\-run}.
Users should always include one of these object files during linking regardless of the actual target runtime environment.
All other object files given to the linker should target the same hardware architecture.

Programs written in \cpp{} need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{cpp\-amd16\-run}, \libfile{cpp\-amd32\-run}, and \libfile{cpp\-amd64\-run} library files respectively.
Programs written in Oberon need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{ob\-amd16\-run}, \libfile{ob\-amd32\-run}, and \libfile{ob\-amd64\-run} library files respectively.

\subsection{BIOS}

The \ecs{} provides basic runtime support for a native PC environment partially established by the BIOS\@.
The actual runtime support is written in assembly language and stored in the object files \objfile{bios16\-run}, \objfile{bios32\-run}, and \objfile{bios64\-run}.
Users creating their own systems may use the \tool{link\-bin} linker together with one of these object files in order create an executable bootloader.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{bios16}, \environment{bios32} or \environment{bios64} target environment achieves the same result.

\subsection{DOS}

Programs targeting the DOS operating system are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates 16-bit COM files if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{dos\-run} object file.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{dos} target environment achieves the same result.

\subsection{EFI}

Programs targeting the Extensible Firmware Interface are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates either 32-bit or 64-bit EFI images~\cite{exefile} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{efi32\-run} and \objfile{efi64\-run} object files respectively.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{efi32} or \environment{efi64} target environment achieves the same result.

\subsection{Linux}

Programs targeting Linux-based operating systems are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates either 32-bit or 64-bit Executable and Linking Format (ELF) files~\cite{elffile} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{amd32\-linux\-run} and \objfile{amd64\-linux\-run} object files respectively.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{amd32\-linux} or \environment{amd64\-linux} target environment achieves the same result.
External libraries are available using additional runtime support stored in the following object files: \objfile{amd32\-libdl}, \objfile{amd32\-libpthread}, \objfile{amd32\-libsdl}, \objfile{amd64\-libdl}, \objfile{amd64\-libpthread}, and \objfile{amd64\-libsdl}.

\subsection{OS~X}

Programs targeting the OS~X operating system are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates either 32-bit or 64-bit Mach-O files~\cite{machofile} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{osx32\-run} and \objfile{osx64\-run} object files respectively.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{osx32} or \environment{osx64} target environment achieves the same result.

\subsection{Windows}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications.
Programs targeting both flavors of this operating system are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates either 32-bit or 64-bit Portable Executable (EXE) files~\cite{exefile} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{win32\-run} and \objfile{win64\-run} object files respectively.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{win32} or \environment{win64} target environment achieves the same result.
Programs run either in the graphical user interface or the character-mode user interface subsystem of Windows.
A program runs as a graphical user interface application if it does neither use the standard streams nor the functions \texttt{abort} or \texttt{\_Exit}.
Functions of the Windows API are available using additional runtime support stored in the \objfile{win32\-api} and \objfile{win64\-api} object files.
External libraries are available using additional runtime support stored in the following object files: \objfile{win32\-sdl} and \objfile{win64\-sdl}.

\section{AMD64 Tools}

The \ecs{} provides the following tools that are able to process object files targeting the AMD64 hardware architecture.
The number in the name of compilers, assemblers, and disassemblers specifies which operating mode defined by the AMD64 architecture is used by default, see Section~\ref{sec:amd64operatingmodes}.
