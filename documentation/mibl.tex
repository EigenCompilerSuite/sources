\startchapter{MicroBlaze}{MicroBlaze Hardware Architecture Support}{mibl}
{This \documentation{} describes how the \ecs{} supports the MicroBlaze hardware architecture.
This includes information about the assembler, disassembler, and the various compilers featured by the \ecs{} as well as the interoperability between these tools.}

\section{Introduction}

The \ecs{} features various compilers, an assembler, and a disassembler that target the MicroBlaze hardware architecture by Xilinx.
Figure~\ref{fig:mibldataflow} shows the data flow in-between these tools.

\label{fig:mibldataflow}
\end{figure}

All compilers targeting the MicroBlaze architecture translate their programs using an intermediate code representation.
The MicroBlaze generator is able to translate the intermediate code representation of a program into machine code for MicroBlaze processors.
It stores the resulting binary code and data in so-called object files.
Additionally, the generator is able to create an assembly code listing of the machine code for debugging purposes.
This assembly code listing can also be processed by the assembler yielding exactly the same object file.
The disassembler is able to open object files and print a human-readable disassembly listing of their contents.

\section{Instruction Set}

Tools targeting the MicroBlaze architecture support the instruction set listed in Table~\ref{tab:miblset} and use the same assembly syntax as predefined by Xilinx~\cite{mibl:instructionset}.

\section{Calling Convention}\index{Calling convention!of MicroBlaze}

The machine code generator and runtime support for the MicroBlaze architecture as provided by the \ecs{} use the following calling convention in order to enable interoperability.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

Arguments for functions are in general passed using the stack according to the intermediate code specification.
See \Documentation{}~\documentationref{code}{Intermediate Code Representation} for more information about the role of the stack.
Function arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order and cleaned by the caller.

\subsection{Register Mapping}

The special-purpose registers defined by the intermediate code representation are mapped to their corresponding physical registers in the following way:

\begin{itemize}

\item Result Register\alignright\texttt{\$res}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code result register \texttt{\$res} is mapped to the MicroBlaze registers \texttt{r4} and \texttt{r5} depending on the size of the actual return type.

\item Stack Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$sp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code stack pointer register \texttt{\$sp} is mapped to the MicroBlaze register \texttt{r1}.

\item Frame Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$fp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code frame pointer register \texttt{\$fp} is mapped to the MicroBlaze register \texttt{r2}.

\item Link Register\alignright\texttt{\$lnk}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code link register \texttt{\$lnk} is supported and mapped to the MicroBlaze register \texttt{r15}.

\end{itemize}

All other intermediate code registers are mapped as needed to the remaining physical registers.
Their contents and mapping are therefore considered volatile across function calls.

\section{Runtime Support}\index{Runtime support!for MicroBlaze}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for the MicroBlaze architecture and runtime environments based on this hardware architecture in object files.
Users targeting a specific runtime environment have to use an appropriate linker together with these object files in order create an executable program.
This section gives information about all supported runtime environments based on the MicroBlaze hardware architecture as well as the required combination of linker and object files.

Basic architectural runtime support is provided by the object file \objfile{mibl\-run}.
Users should always include this object file during linking regardless of the actual target runtime environment.
All other object files given to the linker should target the same hardware architecture.

Programs written in \cpp{} need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{cpp\-mibl\-run} library file.
Programs written in Oberon need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{ob\-mibl\-run} library file.
