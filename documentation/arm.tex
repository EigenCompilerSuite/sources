\startchapter{ARM}{ARM Hardware Architecture Support}{arm}
{This \documentation{} describes how the \ecs{} supports the ARM hardware architecture.
This includes information about the assemblers, disassemblers, and the various compilers featured by the \ecs{} as well as the interoperability between these tools.}

\section{Introduction}

The \ecs{} features various compilers, assemblers, and disassemblers that target the ARM hardware architecture by ARM Limited.
Figure~\ref{fig:armdataflow} shows the data flow in-between these tools.

\end{figure}

All compilers targeting the ARM architecture translate their programs using an intermediate code representation.
The A32, A64 and T32 generators are able to translate the intermediate code representation of a program into machine code for ARM processors executing the respective instruction set.
All of them store the resulting binary code and data in so-called object files.
Additionally, all generators are able to create an assembly code listing of the machine code for debugging purposes.
This assembly code listing can also be processed by the corresponding assembler yielding exactly the same object file.
The corresponding disassembler is able to open object files and print a human-readable disassembly listing of their contents.

\section{Instruction Sets}

Tools targeting the ARM architecture support the instruction sets listed in Tables~\ref{tab:arma32set} to~\ref{tab:armset} and use the same assembly syntax as predefined by the ARM architecture~\cite{arm:instructionset}.
The only exception are immediate values which are not prefixed by a number sign.
\seeassembly

\instructionset{arma32}{Supported ARM A32 instruction set}{5}{6}
\instructionset{arma64}{Supported ARM A64 instruction set}{5}{6}
\instructionset{arm}{Supported ARM T32 instruction set}{5}{6}

The A64 and T32 assemblers allow users to temporarily switch to the A32 instruction set by passing 32 as operand to the bit mode directive.
The original instruction set can be restored using bit modes 64 and 16 respectively.

\section{Calling Convention}\index{Calling convention!of ARM}

The machine code generators and runtime support for the ARM architecture as provided by the \ecs{} use the following calling convention in order to enable interoperability.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

Arguments for functions are in general passed using the stack according to the intermediate code specification.
See \Documentation{}~\documentationref{code}{Intermediate Code Representation} for more information about the role of the stack.
Function arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order and cleaned by the caller.

\subsection{Floating-Point Support}

The ARM architecture optionally supports floating-point operations.
The A32 and A64 generators are able to generate native floating-point operations for processors that do support them.

\subsection{Register Mapping}

The special-purpose registers defined by the intermediate code representation are mapped to their corresponding physical registers in the following way:

\begin{itemize}

\item Result Register\alignright\texttt{\$res}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code result register \texttt{\$res} is mapped to registers \texttt{r0} and \texttt{r1} in 32-bit mode or registers \texttt{w0} or \texttt{x0} in 64-bit mode depending on the size of the actual return type.
If supported natively, floating-point results are stored in registers \texttt{s0} or \texttt{d0} depending on their size.

\item Stack Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$sp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code stack pointer register \texttt{\$sp} is mapped to register \texttt{sp}.

\item Frame Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$fp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code frame pointer register \texttt{\$fp} is mapped to register \texttt{r11} in 32-bit mode or \texttt{x29} in 64-bit mode.

\item Link Register\alignright\texttt{\$lnk}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code link register \texttt{\$lnk} is supported and mapped to register \texttt{lr} in 32-bit mode or register \texttt{x30} in 64-bit mode.

\end{itemize}

All other intermediate code registers are mapped as needed to the remaining physical registers.
Their contents and mapping are therefore considered volatile across function calls.

\section{Runtime Support}\index{Runtime support!for ARM}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for the ARM architecture and runtime environments based on this hardware architecture in object files.
Users targeting a specific runtime environment have to use an appropriate linker together with these object files in order create an executable program.
This section gives information about all supported runtime environments based on the ARM hardware architecture as well as the required combination of linker and object files.

Basic architectural runtime support is provided by the object files \objfile{arma32\-run}, \objfile{arma64\-run}, \objfile{armt32\-run} and \objfile{armt32\-fpe\-run}.
Users should always include one of these object files during linking regardless of the actual target runtime environment.
All other object files given to the linker should target the same hardware architecture.

Programs written in \cpp{} need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{cpp\-arma32\-run}, \libfile{cpp\-arma64\-run}, \libfile{cpp\-armt32\-run} and \libfile{cpp\-armt32\-fpe\-run} library files respectively.
Programs written in Oberon need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{ob\-arma32\-run}, \libfile{ob\-arma64\-run}, \libfile{ob\-armt32\-run} and \libfile{ob\-armt32\-fpe\-run} library files respectively.

\subsection{Linux}

Programs targeting Linux-based operating systems are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates either 32-bit or 64-bit Executable and Linking Format (ELF) files~\cite{elffile} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{arma32\-linux\-run}, \objfile{arma64\-linux\-run}, \objfile{armt32\-linux\-run} and \objfile{armt32\-fpe\-linux\-run} object files respectively.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{arma32\-linux}, \environment{arma64\-linux}, \environment{armt32\-linux} or \environment{armt32\-fpe\-linux} target environment achieves the same result.
External libraries are available using additional runtime support stored in the following object files: \objfile{arma32\-libdl}, \objfile{arma32\-libpthread}, \objfile{arma32\-libsdl}, \objfile{arma64\-libdl}, \objfile{arma64\-libpthread}, \objfile{arma64\-libsdl}, \objfile{armt32\-libdl}, \objfile{armt32\-libpthread}, \objfile{armt32\-libsdl}, \objfile{armt32\-fpe\-libdl}, \objfile{armt32\-fpe\-libpthread}, and \objfile{armt32\-fpe\-libsdl}.

\subsection{Raspberry Pi}

The \ecs{} provides basic runtime support for a native Raspberry Pi~2 Model~B computer environment stored in the \objfile{rpi2b\-run} object file.
Users creating their own systems may use the \tool{link\-bin} linker together with this object file in order create an executable bootloader.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{rpi2b} target environment achieves the same result.
The UART communication device is configured to use a baud rate of 115200~bps with eight data bits, no parity, and one stop bit.
