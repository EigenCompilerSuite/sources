\startchapter{MIPS}{MIPS Hardware Architecture Support}{mips}
{This \documentation{} describes how the \ecs{} supports the MIPS32 and MIPS64 hardware architectures.
This includes information about the assemblers, disassemblers, and the various compilers featured by the \ecs{} as well as the interoperability between these tools.}

\section{Introduction}

The \ecs{} features various compilers, assemblers, and disassemblers that target the MIPS32 and MIPS64 hardware architectures by MIPS Limited.
Figure~\ref{fig:mipsdataflow} shows the data flow in-between these tools.

\end{figure}

All compilers targeting the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures translate their programs using an intermediate code representation.
The MIPS generator is able to translate the intermediate code representation of a program into machine code for MIPS32 and MIPS64 processors.
It stores the resulting binary code and data in so-called object files.
Additionally, the generator is able to create an assembly code listing of the machine code for debugging purposes.
This assembly code listing can also be processed by the assemblers yielding exactly the same object file.
The disassemblers are able to open object files and print a human-readable disassembly listing of their contents.

\section{Instruction Set}

Tools targeting the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures support the instruction set listed in Table~\ref{tab:mipsset} and use the same assembly syntax as predefined by MIPS~\cite{mips:volume1,mips:volume2}.
\seeassembly

\instructionset{mips}{Supported MIPS32 and MIPS64 instruction set}{5}{6}

The actual architecture the compilers and assemblers generate machine code for by default, is indicated by the number in the suffix of their names.
The assemblers allow users to temporarily switch between the supported architectures by passing 32 or 64 as operand to the bit mode directive.
The default ordering of the binary encoding of instructions is least significant octet first but can be changed using the big-endian mode directive.

\section{Calling Convention}\index{Calling convention!of MIPS}

The machine code generator and runtime support for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures as provided by the \ecs{} use the following calling convention in order to enable interoperability.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

Arguments for functions are in general passed using the stack according to the intermediate code specification.
See \Documentation{}~\documentationref{code}{Intermediate Code Representation} for more information about the role of the stack.
Function arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order and cleaned by the caller.

\subsection{Floating-Point Support}

The MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures optionally support floating-point operations.
The MIPS generator is able to generate native floating-point operations for processors that do support them.

\subsection{Register Mapping}

The special-purpose registers defined by the intermediate code representation are mapped to their corresponding physical registers in the following way:

\begin{itemize}

\item Result Register\alignright\texttt{\$res}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code result register \texttt{\$res} is mapped to MIPS registers \texttt{r2} and \texttt{r3} depending on the size of the actual result value.
If supported natively, floating-point results are stored in the register \texttt{f0}.

\item Stack Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$sp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code stack pointer register \texttt{\$sp} is mapped to the MIPS register \texttt{r29}.

\item Frame Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$fp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code frame pointer register \texttt{\$fp} is mapped to the MIPS register \texttt{r30}.

\item Link Register\alignright\texttt{\$lnk}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code link register \texttt{\$lnk} is supported and mapped to the MIPS register \texttt{r31}.

\end{itemize}

All other intermediate code registers are mapped as needed to the remaining physical registers.
Their contents and mapping are therefore considered volatile across function calls.
Registers holding integer and address values are mapped to the general-purpose registers,
while registers holding floating-point values are mapped to the floating-point registers.

\section{Runtime Support}\index{Runtime support!for MIPS}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for the MIPS architecture and runtime environments based on this hardware architecture in object files.
Users targeting a specific runtime environment have to use an appropriate linker together with these object files in order create an executable program.
This section gives information about all supported runtime environments based on the MIPS hardware architecture as well as the required combination of linker and object files.

Basic architectural runtime support is provided by the object files \objfile{mips32\-run} and \objfile{mips64\-run}.
Users should always include one of these object files during linking regardless of the actual target runtime environment.
All other object files given to the linker should target the same hardware architecture.

Programs written in \cpp{} need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{cpp\-mips32\-run} and \libfile{cpp\-mips64\-run} library files respectively.
Programs written in Oberon need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{ob\-mips32\-run} and \libfile{ob\-mips64\-run} library files respectively.
