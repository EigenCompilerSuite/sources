\startchapter{WebAssembly}{WebAssembly Architecture Support}{wasm}
{This \documentation{} describes how the \ecs{} supports the WebAssembly architecture.
This includes information about the assembler, disassembler, and the various compilers featured by the \ecs{} as well as the interoperability between these tools.}

\section{Introduction}

The \ecs{} features various compilers, an assembler, and a disassembler that target the WebAssembly architecture.
Figure~\ref{fig:wasmdataflow} shows the data flow in-between these tools.

\end{figure}

All compilers targeting the WebAssembly architecture translate their programs using an intermediate code representation.
The WebAssembly generator is able to translate the intermediate code representation of a program into machine code for WebAssembly targets.
It stores the resulting binary code and data in so-called object files.
Additionally, the generator is able to create an assembly code listing of the machine code for debugging purposes.
This assembly code listing can also be processed by the assembler yielding exactly the same object file.
The disassembler is able to open object files and print a human-readable disassembly listing of their contents.

\section{Instruction Set}

Tools targeting the WebAssembly architecture support the instruction set listed in Table~\ref{tab:wasmset} and use the same assembly syntax as predefined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)~\cite{wasm:instructionset}.
The only exception are the addition of the pseudo instructions \texttt{i32}, \texttt{label}, \texttt{lane}, \texttt{s32}, \texttt{u32}, and \texttt{valtype}.
They encode an immediate value of the respective type with a fixed size and can be used as a replacement for operands of instructions that require immediate values of that type.

\section{Calling Convention}\index{Calling convention!of WebAssembly}

The machine code generator and runtime support for the WebAssembly architecture as provided by the \ecs{} use the following calling convention in order to enable interoperability.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

Arguments for functions are in general passed using the stack according to the intermediate code specification.
See \Documentation{}~\documentationref{code}{Intermediate Code Representation} for more information about the role of the stack.
Function arguments are pushed on the stack in reverse order and cleaned by the caller.

\subsection{Register Mapping}

The special-purpose registers defined by the intermediate code representation are mapped to mutable WebAssembly globals in the following way:

\begin{itemize}

\item Result Register\alignright\texttt{\$res}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code result register \texttt{\$res} is mapped to WebAssembly globals called \texttt{_\$res_i32}, \texttt{_\$res_i64}, \texttt{_\$res_f32}, and \texttt{_\$res_f64} with the respective types.

\item Stack Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$sp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code stack pointer register \texttt{\$sp} is mapped to a WebAssembly global called \texttt{_\$sp} with type \texttt{i32}.

\item Frame Pointer Register\alignright\texttt{\$fp}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code frame pointer register \texttt{\$fp} is mapped to a WebAssembly global called \texttt{_\$fp} with type \texttt{i32}.

\item Link Register\alignright\texttt{\$lnk}\nopagebreak

The intermediate code link register \texttt{\$lnk} as well as return addresses are not supported.

\end{itemize}

All other intermediate code registers are mapped as needed to WebAssembly locals.
Their contents and mapping are therefore not considered volatile across function calls.

\section{Runtime Support}\index{Runtime support!for WebAssembly}

The \ecs{} provides runtime support for the WebAssembly architecture and runtime environments based on this architecture in object files.
Users targeting a specific runtime environment have to use an appropriate linker together with these object files in order create an executable program.
This section gives information about all supported runtime environments based on the WebAssembly architecture as well as the required combination of linker and object files.

Basic architectural runtime support is provided by the object file \objfile{wasm\-run}.
Users should always include this object file during linking regardless of the actual target runtime environment.
All other object files given to the linker should target the same architecture.

Programs written in \cpp{} need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{cpp\-wasm\-run} library file.
Programs written in Oberon need additional runtime support stored in the \libfile{ob\-wasm\-run} library file.
\seecpp\seeoberon

Programs targeting web environments are created using the \tool{link\-bin} linker tool.
It creates a WebAssembly module~\cite{wasm:instructionset} if provided with the runtime support stored in the \objfile{web\-assembly\-run} object file.
Calling the \tool{ecsd} utility tool using the \environment{web\-assembly} target environment achieves the same result.

\section{WebAssembly Tools}

The \ecs{} provides the following tools that are able to process object files targeting the WebAssembly architecture.
